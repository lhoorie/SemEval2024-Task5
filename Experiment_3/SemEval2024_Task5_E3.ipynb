Carmichael later sued Faithful for breach of contract and fraud, raising the same claims as Gotschall. Since the same issues were already litigated and decided in Gotschall's action, the court would likely bar Carmichael from relitigating either issue based on issue preclusion. Therefore, the generated answer is correct.\n",

In this case, Gotschall had already sued Faithful and lost on the claim that the brochure fraudulently promised a 15 percent rate of return. However, Carmichael is a new party who has not litigated that issue before.

Personal jurisdiction refers to a court's authority to hear and decide a case involving a particular defendant. In order for a court to have personal jurisdiction over a defendant, there must be minimum contacts between the defendant and the forum state. The Supreme Court has established that a defendant can be subject to personal jurisdiction in a state if they have sufficient minimum contacts with that state, such that it would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\n",

            "In this case, Dispos-All is a waste disposal corporation that collects hazardous wastes from manufacturers in Delaware and Virginia and stores them in a landfill in Delaware, which is within a mile of the Maryland border. The landfill is lined to prevent chemicals from leaching into the groundwater. However, on several occasions, one of Dispos-All's drivers, Marquette, tipped his truck along the edge of the lined area, causing some waste to slide off onto the ground. The groundwater studies show that the groundwater runs under the landfill toward an aquifer across the Maryland border, which is used to supply water to nearby homes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given these facts, it can be argued that Dispos-All can foresee that negligent disposal at its Delaware facility could cause harm to persons and property in Maryland. The contaminants from the landfill could potentially spread to the aquifer, which is a source of water for nearby homes, including Wasnowski's well. Therefore, Dispos-All's actions have a direct impact on Maryland residents, including the plaintiff.

            "Detailed Reasoning:\n",
            "The generated answer is incorrect. Personal jurisdiction is determined by the minimum contacts a defendant has with the forum state. In this case, Dispos-All is a waste collection company that operates in Delaware and Virginia, and their landfill is located in Delaware. The fact that some waste may have slid off onto the ground near the Maryland border does not establish sufficient minimum contacts with Maryland to subject Dispos-All to personal jurisdiction in Maryland.\n",
            "\n",
            "The stream of commerce doctrine typically applies to cases involving the sale or distribution of goods, where a defendant's products are regularly sold or distributed in the forum state. In this case, Dispos-All is not engaged in the sale or distribution of goods, but rather in the collection and disposal of hazardous waste. Therefore, the stream of commerce doctrine does not apply in this context.\n",
            "\n",
            "Furthermore, the fact that groundwater studies show the groundwater runs under the landfill toward an aquifer across the Maryland border does not automatically establish personal jurisdiction.

Since Whitney was injured in Vermont, the Rhode Island court would apply Vermont law.

            "Explanation: Hereโs a challenging Closer that involves removal under ยง1441(a), supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง1367(a), and the ยง1441(b)(2) limit on removal of diversity cases. Good luck!  The basic standard for removal jurisdiction is simple and sensible: a defendant sued in state court may remove a case to federal court if it could have been filed originally in federal court. The rationale for removal is to give both parties access to federal court for cases within the federal courtโs jurisdiction. So it makes sense that the standard for removing a case to federal court should mirror the standard for filing one in federal court to begin with. So, 28 U.S.C. ยง1441(a) provides that โโany civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdictionโโ may be removed to federal court. Consequently, the first question to ask in analyzing a removal problem is whether the claim asserted by the plaintiff fits into some category of federal jurisdiction. Is it a diversity case, or an arising-under case? A case between a citizen and foreign citizen, or some other case provided for in Article III, ยง2? If not, it canโt be removed. If it is, then, with a few minor exceptions, it can be. Hereโs a first example to illustrate this relation between original and removal jurisdiction.  While it is generally true that a case that could have been filed in federal court can be removed there, it is not always true. The removal statute provides that a diversity case cannot be removed if there is an in-state defendant: ยง1441(b)(2). A civil action removable solely on the basis of the jurisdiction under section 1332(a) of this title may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the state in which such action is brought. This is a sensible limit on removal, given the rationale for federal diversity jurisdiction. The logic for allowing diversity cases to be brought in federal court is the risk of prejudice in the state court; but if a defendant is sued in her home state, she is not at risk of prejudice. If Coretta, from Wisconsin, sues Parkins, from Iowa, in an Iowa state court, there is little reason to allow Parkins to remove. Any prejudice in the state court would be in favor of Parkins, so why allow her to bump the case into federal court? Section 1441 (b)(2) therefore bars her from doing so. Consider this illustration. \n",

If it is, then, with a few minor exceptions, it can be. Hereโs a first example to illustrate this relation between original and removal jurisdiction.  While it is generally true that a case that could have been filed in federal court can be removed there, it is not always true. The removal statute provides that a diversity case cannot be removed if there is an in-state defendant: ยง1441(b)(2). A civil action removable solely on the basis of the jurisdiction under section 1332(a) of this title may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the state in which such action is brought. This is a sensible limit on removal, given the rationale for federal diversity jurisdiction. The logic for allowing diversity cases to be brought in federal court is the risk of prejudice in the state court; but if a defendant is sued in her home state, she is not at risk of prejudice. If Coretta, from Wisconsin, sues Parkins, from Iowa, in an Iowa state court, there is little reason to allow Parkins to remove. Any prejudice in the state court would be in favor of Parkins, so why allow her to bump the case into federal court? Section 1441 (b)(2) therefore bars her from doing so. Consider this illustration. \n",

Civ. Proc. Code ยง410.10. Here, the statute really does โโgo to the limits of due process,โโ in that it authorizes all jurisdiction that is constitutionally permissible. But a good many states donโt have long-arm statutes like Californiaโs. Instead, they have โโenumerated actโโ long-arm statutes that authorize jurisdiction if the defendant has done certain acts in the state, such as transacting business, contracting to supply goods, insuring a risk, or committing a tortious act in the state. In these states, itโs a little unclear what a court means when it says that the long-arm statute โโgoes to the limits of due process.โโ Yet, it just canโt mean that anything constitutional goes. If it did, the specific provisions of the statute would simply be irrelevant, wouldnโt they? Consider the following question, which illustrates the problem with interpreting all long-arm statutes to โโgo to the limits of due process.โโ \n",

            "Explanation:  Closers are designed to be tough. So a โโKiller Closerโโ should be even worse. Closers are optional. You have no one to blame but yourself.  The natural inclination of the defendant who thinks sheโs been sued in the wrong court is to protest. Youโd feel the same way. โโHey, wait! This case doesnโt belong here; throw it out.โโ All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the courtโs exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the โโspecial appearance.โโ The defendant would โโappear speciallyโโ for the sole purpose of objecting to the courtโs jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the courtโs authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the courtโs jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have โโappeared generally,โโ waiving her special appearance and accepting the courtโs power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiffโs motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a โโspecial appearanceโโ had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the courtโs jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, thereโs a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendantโs first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isnโt right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant shouldโvery carefullyโenter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Hereโs a question to test the point. Iโve tried to make it a little tricky, but if youโve read the discussion above it should be easy.  A defendant sued away from home has another option if she believes that the court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. She may ignore the suit entirely. Suppose that Ito, sued by Ervin in Emporia, never moves to dismiss, never appears specially, simply ignores the law suit. What will happen? The court will very likely assume that Ito has no defense to the claim, and enter a default judgment for Ervin on the claim. But who cares? If Ito has no property in Emporia, and no plans to go there personally, Ervin wonโt be able to collect the judgment there. He will have to come to Itoโs state to enforce the judgment. This is often done by bringing an action for a โโjudgment on the judgmentโโ in the enforcing state, to convert the Emporia judgment into a judgment of the enforcing state. Once Ervin obtains such a judgment in the state where he seeks to enforce the judgment, he can invoke its judgment-collection procedures to collect the judgment from Ito. Suppose, for example, that Ito lives in the state of Acadia, and has property there that could be sold to satisfy Ervinโs judgment. An Acadia court would not order โโexecutionโโ on an Emporia judgment, that is, the use of its court procedures to collect the Emporia judgment from Itoโs assets. Acadia courts only enforce Acadia judgments. So, Ervin would have to bring a suit in the courts of Acadia, asking the court to enter an Acadia judgment on the Emporia judgment. This is a new law suit; Ervinโs the plaintiff, Itoโs the defendant. Ito will be served with process in the enforcement action and have an opportunity to raise any defenses he may have. States generally have to honor each otherโs judgments, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. Acadia would be bound, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, to recognize the Emporia judgment by entering an Acadia judgment recognizing it. Once that has been done, Ervin has an Acadia judgment against an Acadia defendant, and can use local court procedures to have Itoโs assets sold to satisfy his judgment.1 However, states do not automatically honor all judgments of other states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. A defendant in Itoโs position can raise certain narrow defenses to enforcing the Emporia judgment . . . including the defense that the court that rendered the judgment lacked the power to do so. Even before Pennoyer v. Neff, courts allowed judgment debtors to resist enforcement of judgments on the ground that the court that rendered the judgment lacked personal jurisdiction. In the earlier cases, it was supposed that the [full faith and credit] act gave to all judgments the same effect in other States which they had by law in the State where rendered. But this view was afterwards qualified so as to make the act applicable only when the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject- matter, and not to preclude an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the right of the State itself to exercise authority over the person or the subject-matter. Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 729 (1877). So, Ervin may bring his Emporia judgment to Acadia to enforce, and Ito may try to convince the court not to enforce it because the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him.

This is often done by bringing an action for a โโjudgment on the judgmentโโ in the enforcing state, to convert the Emporia judgment into a judgment of the enforcing state. Once Ervin obtains such a judgment in the state where he seeks to enforce the judgment, he can invoke its judgment-collection procedures to collect the judgment from Ito. Suppose, for example, that Ito lives in the state of Acadia, and has property there that could be sold to satisfy Ervinโs judgment. An Acadia court would not order โโexecutionโโ on an Emporia judgment, that is, the use of its court procedures to collect the Emporia judgment from Itoโs assets. Acadia courts only enforce Acadia judgments. So, Ervin would have to bring a suit in the courts of Acadia, asking the court to enter an Acadia judgment on the Emporia judgment. This is a new law suit; Ervinโs the plaintiff, Itoโs the defendant. Ito will be served with process in the enforcement action and have an opportunity to raise any defenses he may have. States generally have to honor each otherโs judgments, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. Acadia would be bound, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, to recognize the Emporia judgment by entering an Acadia judgment recognizing it. Once that has been done, Ervin has an Acadia judgment against an Acadia defendant, and can use local court procedures to have Itoโs assets sold to satisfy his judgment.1 However, states do not automatically honor all judgments of other states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. A defendant in Itoโs position can raise certain narrow defenses to enforcing the Emporia judgment . . . including the defense that the court that rendered the judgment lacked the power to do so. Even before Pennoyer v. Neff, courts allowed judgment debtors to resist enforcement of judgments on the ground that the court that rendered the judgment lacked personal jurisdiction. In the earlier cases, it was supposed that the [full faith and credit] act gave to all judgments the same effect in other States which they had by law in the State where rendered. But this view was afterwards qualified so as to make the act applicable only when the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject- matter, and not to preclude an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the right of the State itself to exercise authority over the person or the subject-matter. Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 729 (1877). So, Ervin may bring his Emporia judgment to Acadia to enforce, and Ito may try to convince the court not to enforce it because the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him.

            "Question: 8. Impersonal jurisdiction. Ervin sues Ito, from Acadia, for fraud in a sale of stock. He brings the action in an Emporia court. Ito defends the case on the merits and loses; the case ends in a judgment for Ervin for $50,000. Ervin now brings suit in New Mexico, where Ito (who lives in Acadia) owns a valuable two-week time share at a resort. Ervin seeks a judgment on the Emporia judgment, so that he can obtain a New Mexico court order for sale of the time share to satisfy his judgment. Ito appears and objects to the New Mexico court exercising personal jurisdiction over him for Ervinโs claim. He argues that he has no minimum contacts with New Mexico that gave rise to this claim, and that he is not subject to general in personam jurisdiction in New Mexico based on owning a time share there. If the judge agrees that the New Mexico court has no basis to exercise personal jurisdiction over Ito for Ervinโs underlying fraud claim, she will likely\n",

            "Explanation:  Closers are designed to be tough. So a โโKiller Closerโโ should be even worse. Closers are optional. You have no one to blame but yourself.  The natural inclination of the defendant who thinks sheโs been sued in the wrong court is to protest. Youโd feel the same way. โโHey, wait! This case doesnโt belong here; throw it out.โโ All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the courtโs exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the โโspecial appearance.โโ The defendant would โโappear speciallyโโ for the sole purpose of objecting to the courtโs jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the courtโs authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the courtโs jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have โโappeared generally,โโ waiving her special appearance and accepting the courtโs power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiffโs motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a โโspecial appearanceโโ had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the courtโs jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, thereโs a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendantโs first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isnโt right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant shouldโvery carefullyโenter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Hereโs a question to test the point. Iโve tried to make it a little tricky, but if youโve read the discussion above it should be easy.  A defendant sued away from home has another option if she believes that the court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. She may ignore the suit entirely. Suppose that Ito, sued by Ervin in Emporia, never moves to dismiss, never appears specially, simply ignores the law suit. What will happen? The court will very likely assume that Ito has no defense to the claim, and enter a default judgment for Ervin on the claim. But who cares? If Ito has no property in Emporia, and no plans to go there personally, Ervin wonโt be able to collect the judgment there. He will have to come to Itoโs state to enforce the judgment. This is often done by bringing an action for a โโjudgment on the judgmentโโ in the enforcing state, to convert the Emporia judgment into a judgment of the enforcing state. Once Ervin obtains such a judgment in the state where he seeks to enforce the judgment, he can invoke its judgment-collection procedures to collect the judgment from Ito. Suppose, for example, that Ito lives in the state of Acadia, and has property there that could be sold to satisfy Ervinโs judgment. An Acadia court would not order โโexecutionโโ on an Emporia judgment, that is, the use of its court procedures to collect the Emporia judgment from Itoโs assets. Acadia courts only enforce Acadia judgments. So, Ervin would have to bring a suit in the courts of Acadia, asking the court to enter an Acadia judgment on the Emporia judgment.
